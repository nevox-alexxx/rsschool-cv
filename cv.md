## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
I aim to develop a data compression algorithm that could have a global impact. Ok, seriously at the moment my priority is to study and get my first professional experience in IT. I've worked in various fields in the pastâ€”musician, bookkeeper's assistant, magician's assistant, and event operatorâ€”but programming has brought me the most satisfaction. My dedication to learning comes from discipline, not motivation; I am passionate about continuous growth and cannot imagine life without it.
